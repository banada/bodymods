# Overview

Here you will find a series of meshes designed for the [comma body](https://www.commabody.com/).

## 3D Printing

All of these meshes are designed to be easily 3D printed. I use Ultimaker Cura to do the slicing and I print with an Ender 3 Pro.

## Hardware

The hardware used by some of these meshes (screws, t-slot nuts, hex nuts, washers, etc) may be found on Amazon:
