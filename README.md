# Overview

Here you will find a series of 3D printable designs I am creating for the [comma body](https://www.commabody.com/). 

Explore the `meshes` directory to see what I've got so far. I will continue to add more as I come up with new ideas and make refinements.

## Hardware

The hardware used by some of these meshes (screws, t-slot nuts, hex nuts, washers, etc) may be found on Amazon:
