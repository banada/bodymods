# Overview

Here you will find a series of 3D printable designs I am creating for the [comma body](https://www.commabody.com/). 

Explore the `meshes` directory to see what I've got so far. I will continue to add more as I come up with new ideas and make refinements.

## Hardware

The hardware used by some of these meshes (screws, t-slot nuts, hex nuts, washers, etc) may be found on Amazon:
* [PZRT 12-Pack Roll in Spring M6 T Nuts,3030/4040 Series Universal with Spring Sheet,Carbon Steel Nickel-Plated for for 8mm Slot Aluminum Profile](https://amzn.to/3sMyVVq)

Donations are totally not expected, but I am very grateful to those that wish to because it indicates that my work is valuable which in turn motivates more creation.
